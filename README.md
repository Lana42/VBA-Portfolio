# VBA-Portfolio for Lana McClaren

## Description
This a collection of Microsoft Excel macros written visual basic for application. They range from simplifying small tasks to reorganizing data and creating reports.

## Installation
Most macros can be run from the PERSONAL.XLSB in excel. Others can run from macro enabled workbooks. Which method to employ will be indicated in the macro's file.
Most macros will be able to run on any version of Excel from 2007 on. If a macro is not supported in Excel 2007, it will be noted in the macros description.

## Usage
The details of the purpose of each macro will be outlined in the macro file.

## Requirements
Certain macros may require mock data to run. For those, a data file will be included with the code.

## Support
Many of these macros are used to develop my advanced VBA course on [Academy_201_Beyond_the_Basics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChTxdxyy_NVPW7hNSRS1dzA/). This video series will go into more detail about how these macros were put together and give more detailed information about VBA.

## Contributing 
Contributions are welcome. However, these macros are finished products. If you use them for your own projects, modifications may be necessary.
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
